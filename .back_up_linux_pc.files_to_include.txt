# List of source files for rsync to copy
#
# See `man rsync` and search for "--include-from=FILE".
# - "Blank lines in the  file  and  lines starting with ’;’ or ’#’ are ignored."
# - NB: per the rsync man pages, sort this list to help rsync "to be more efficient".
# - NB: adding the `/` before each folder here is NOT what makes these paths relative to the root
#   dir. Rather, setting `SRC='/'` in the main script is what does that! Exclude paths are always
#   relative to the source path specified in the rsync command! Having the `/` before a path here
#   does nothing, and is purely for aesthetic reasons since in this case it really is relative to
#   the root dir.
#
# - SUPER IMPORTANT! - YOU MUST *NOT* HAVE ANY EXTRANEOUS SPACES **OR EVEN COMMENTS** AT THE END OF     <====== IMPORTANT! =======
#   ANY INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE LINE OR ELSE I WILL REQUIRE THOSE CHARS TO BE PRESENT IN THE FILE/FOLDER
#   MATCH IT IS LOOKING FOR, OR IT WILL FAIL TO MATCH!
#   - If you violate this, you'll get `link_stat` errors such as this:
#           ```
#           rsync: link_stat "/var # some comment here" failed: No such file or directory (2)
#           ```
#
# See also the "INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES" section in `man rsync` for wildcard matching rules. <===

# Root Ubuntu dirs to back up by default.
# - Note that the "exclude_files" file will override any includes. For a file or folder to be
#   backed up by rsync, it must be *in* the include list and *not* in the exclude list.
# ==================================================================================================

# REMINDER: NO COMMENTS NOR SPACES ARE ALLOWED AT THE END OF ANY INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE LINE!  <======== DON'T FAIL TO MATCH! ========
